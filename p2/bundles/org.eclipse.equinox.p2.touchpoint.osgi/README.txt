This bundle is a simple experiment to create an OSGi framework agnostic touchpoint.
What is the difference with the eclipse touchpoint?
- It can only manipulate a framework in process, whereas the eclipse touchpoint can manipulate a framework out of process
- The installBundle and collect actions are implemented slightly differently
