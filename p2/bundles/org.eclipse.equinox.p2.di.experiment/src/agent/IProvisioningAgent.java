 * A provisioning agent is comprised of a modular, extensible set of related services.
 * Each agent instance has its own separate instances of these services that are
 * not shared with other agents. There is at most one instance of a given service
 * tracked by an agent at any given time, which ensures all services that make
 * up an agent instance share common service instances with each other.
 * <p>
 * Services are registered with an agent either directly, via the {@link #registerService(String, Object)}
 * method, or indirectly by registering an {@link IAgentServiceFactory} in the OSGi
 * service registry.
